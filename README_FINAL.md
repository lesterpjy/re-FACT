## Notebooks locations and Usage

### Experiment 1

### Experiment 2

- circuit identification with EAP/EAP-IG 
  - sif file must be generated with [dockerim2sif.job](https://github.com/lesterpjy/reFACT/blob/main/snellius_env/dockerim2sif.job) to convert our docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/lesterpjy10/refact-multiarch) on dockerhub to an Apptainer Image. 
  - `snellius_env/run_get_circuit_toxicity.job` runs `python /local/scripts/get_circuit.py --config_path ../configs/llama3_config_toxicity.py` with the Apptainer image to get the toxicity circuits (`work/visualize_circuits/toxicity_combined.csv`)
  -  `snellius_env/run_get_circuit_adv_bias.job` runs `python /local/scripts/get_circuit.py --config_path ../configs/llama3_config_adv_bias.py` with the Apptainer image to get the name bias circuits (`work/visualize_circuits/full_adv_bias.csv`)
  - `work/visualize_circuits/visualize.ipynb` converts the csv files containing the EAP scores and the saved computation graphs in json into visualizations for the paper. It also performs the egde pruning for generating the graphs used in Experiment 5 for bias mitigation. Necessary files are self-contained in `work/visualize_circuits`.

### Experiment 3

- src/org_paper/grad_experiment_acro.ipynb - notebook used to generate adversarial samples for authors' task
- src/adv_sample/sample_generation.ipynb - notebook used to generate adversarial samples for our task

### Experiment 4

- src/adv_attack/vul_heads_detection.ipynb - notebook for creating results of vulnerable heads using authors' method 

### Experiment 5 

-s rc/dataset_generation/circuit_adv_data.ipynb - notebook for creating dataset for bias circuit from adversarial samples

- src/bias_scale_results.ipynb - notebook about results of Experiment 5, scaling down the edges to mitigate the bias

### Others

- src/plots.ipynb - notebook for additional plots for the paper


## Docker reproducibility management

Directories `configs`, `scripts`, `src` are mounted in the Docker image, and should contain all code for readers to reproduce our results: main program contained in `src`, experiment settings contained in `configs`, and `scripts` that run experiments using `config` and `src`.

Local directories `cache`, `data`, `work` are for managing your work. These are in `gitignore` and are not commited. 

`snellius_env` is for us to keep track of our job files.

### Example workflow

#### Local development workflow

Since `src`, `scripts`, and `configs` directories are mounted in real-time from your local machine, changes to your code appear immediately inside the containear.

  1. Modify code or script.
  2. Ensure Docker Desktop is set to Linux container mode on Windows (or simply use Docker on macOS).
  3. Pull the latest image from Docker Hub: `docker pull lesterpjy10/refact-multiarch:latest`
  4. Set test/run alias (Remove `--gpus all` for local without gpu) 
     ```
     alias dtest="docker run --rm -it \
	 -v $(pwd)/data:/local/data \
	 -v $(pwd)/cache:/local/cache \
	 -v $(pwd)/work:/local/work \
	 -v $(pwd)/src:/local/src \
	 -v $(pwd)/scripts:/local/scripts \
	 -v $(pwd)/configs:/local/configs \
	 --gpus all"
  5. Run an interactive test: `dtest lesterpjy10/refact-multiarch:latest bash`
  6. Or, for environment sanity check, run `dtest lesterpjy10/refact-multiarch python scripts/test_env.py` 
 
#### Committing and tagging for release

  1. Once you are satisfied with local testing, **add-commit-push** to your branch (this does not build the image)
  2. To release an image:
     ```
     git tag build-* 
     git push origin build-*
     ```
     replace `*` with an unique name. Alternatively, builds could be triggered in the Github action UI for the default branch.
  3. Github Action will spin up, build linux/amd64 + linux/arm64 images, and push them to Docker Hub as:
     ```
     lesterpjy10/refact-multiarch:latest
     lesterpjy10/refact-multiarch:build-*
     ```

#### Test and run image on Snellius

  1. Pull your changes on Snellius
  2. Edit user name in job file `snellius_env/dockerim2sif.job` Replace `/tmp/scur2818XXXX` for `APPTAINER_TMPDIR` with your own user name, if your SURF username is `user01`, change to `/tmp/user01XXXX`
  3. Run `sbatch snellius_env/dockerim2sif.job` to pull Docker image from Dockerhub, and convert image to sif file for Apptainer.
  4. Check sif file successfully built by inspecting output file `work/build_container_*.out`
  5. Run `sbatch snellius_env/test_env.job` to test container environment with `Apptainer run`
  6. Check package successfully installed by inspecting the output file under `work` directory.
  7. `test_env.py` output should look like:
     ```
